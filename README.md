ProgressiveRayTracer
====================

This is an early implementation of a progressive ray tracer using the graphics engine, G3D.  Instructions for downloading and installing G3D can be found here: http://g3d.sourceforge.net/.

The threading is not yet correct, so for now, the image has to be fully rendered before any motion can occur.  The program will freeze if you move the camera too fast, but fixing that is a top priority.
